# 🦵 Precision Knee Osteoarthritis Diagnosis with CNN

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect and classify Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) severity from X-ray images with **94% accuracy**. It aims to support early diagnosis, improve treatment planning, and enhance patient care.

## 🚀 Features
- Automatic OA detection from knee X-rays
- Classification into multiple severity levels
- End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing → training → classification
- Research-backed methodology, published in 2024

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras
- CNN for image classification
- Data preprocessing & augmentation
